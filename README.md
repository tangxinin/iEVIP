# R code for iEVIP: A Dual-inspired Intelligent Platform for Smart Response Extracellular Vesicle Isolation and Single-Vesicle Profiling
This GitHub repository contains R scripts used for data visualization, multivariate analysis, and classification in this study, including Heatmap,PCA, PLS-DA, LDA, and  RF + LDA + NN (k = 5).

The file 20240614.csv contains data derived from cell-based experiments. Each row corresponds to an independent cell sample, and columns represent measured features used for subsequent multivariate analyses, including heatmap visualization, PCA, PLS-DA, LDA, and combined classification models.
## Software requirements
All analyses were performed using **R version 4.3.0**.
The following software is required:
* **R (version 4.3.0)**
---
## Installation of R
R (version 4.3.0) can be downloaded and installed from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN):
* [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org)
Installation instructions are provided on the CRAN website for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
---
## Required R packages
The scripts rely on commonly used R packages for data analysis and visualization.
All packages can be installed  using:
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "pheatmap", "mixOmics", "MASS",
                   "randomForest", "caret", "pROC"))
                   
## Description of individual scripts

1. **Heatmap.R**
   
    This script performs data normalization (if applicable) and generates heatmaps to visualize global expression or feature patterns across samples. It is used to explore overall sample similarity, clustering patterns, and potential group-specific trends.

2. **PCA.R**
   
    This script conducts **principal component analysis (PCA)** as an unsupervised dimensionality reduction method. PCA is used to visualize the overall structure of the dataset, identify dominant sources of variance, and detect potential outliers.

3. **PLS-DA.R**
   
    This script performs **partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)** as a supervised multivariate classification approach. It is used to assess group separation and identify features contributing most strongly to class discrimination.
   
5. **LDA.R**
   
    This script applies **linear discriminant analysis (LDA)** as a linear and interpretable classification method. LDA serves as a baseline classifier for comparison with nonlinear models.
7. **RF+LDA+NN(k=5).R**
This script implements and compares multiple classification models, including **Random Forest (RF)**, **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**, and **k-nearest neighbor (k-NN, k = 5)**. It is used to evaluate classification performance under different modeling assumptions and to assess model robustness.
## Reproducibility
All scripts were executed using **R version 4.3.0**. Where applicable, random seeds were set within the scripts to ensure reproducibility. Output figures and tables generated by the scripts correspond to those presented in the manuscript.
## Code availability (for manuscript)
All R scripts used for heatmap visualization, PCA, PLS-DA, LDA, and combined classification analyses (RF, LDA, and k-NN with k = 5) are available on GitHub, together with instructions for software installation and execution.
